# Layout

## Here is a layout for a meal planning app

1. Home Screen: This screen would be the first screen that the user sees when opening the app. It would have a clean modern design, and feature the following sections:

- Today's Meal Plan: This section would show the meals planned for the day, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
- Grocery List: This section would show the user's grocery list, which they can add to as they plan their meals.
- Meal Suggestions: This section would show the user meal suggestions based on their dietary preferences, cooking skill level, and ingredient availability.

- Meal Planning Screen: This screen would allow the user to plan their meals for the week. It would feature a calendar view with each day of the week displayed. The user would be able to select a day to plan meals for, and then add breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks for that day. They would also be able to view their grocery list for the week and make any necessary changes.

- Recipe Screen: This screen would allow the user to search for and view recipes. The user would be able to filter recipes by ingredients, dietary preferences, and cooking time. Each recipe would include a list of ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.

- Grocery List Screen: This screen would allow the user to view and edit their grocery list. They would be able to add or remove items, and mark off items as they purchase them.

- Profile Screen: This screen would allow the user to manage their profile and preferences. They would be able to update their dietary preferences, cooking skill level, and ingredient availability. They would also be able to view their meal history and plan future meals.
